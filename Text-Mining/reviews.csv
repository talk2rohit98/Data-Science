"R1CXD23230IN1T","Hemant","This activity tracker does nothing. The heart rate monitor doesn't monitor your heart beat continuously. You have to swipe to heart beat option, then click on it for it to start recording the heart beat, and even after doing all this it will show you just one reading. After which you have to refresh by tapping for it to start recording again. And then it will show you just one reading again.What an absolute disgusting process.Fitbit and some others have heart beat continuous monitoring, so when you are running you can check your heart beat instantly and continuously. This one is pointless.I wish they had a return option, but they have only a replace option. This is a useless tracker.

"R2M69GH6Z7MAP3","TechBuff","Nowadays, people are provided misleading information left & right! E.g. not sure how so many people placed good reviews on this item, but let me clarify what this band is in reality.𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐈 𝐛𝐮𝐲?I didn't have time to do enough investigation/research. I blindly went with Amazon review & this band appeared to have gained enough positive vibes. So, in a rush - I purchased this looking at 2 specific aspects:- It has SP02- It was water resistant𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐬:- SP02 works (well, I couldn't verify count against any pulse oximeter, but against another mobile sensor based reading - this appears more or less ok)- It is kind of water resistant, so I am ok to wear it all dayBased on these 2 parameters - I am giving it 2 stars *𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬:- Step counter is literally super intelligent! It creates its own count! Even if you don't move - it makes you feel happy by showing ever increasing steps! 😂- The actual watch comes out - from under the band. So, if you have any habit of taking your watch out frequently, beware - you may soon lose your watch.- Charger is again not that user friendly.- The app is not professional at all. It did connect easily, but keeps on disconnecting frequently (& then reconnects on its own).𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧:- At this price point, I am not happy with the purchase!- I will advise to rather add a bit more to your budget & buy a smart watch (not band)- This is definitely NOT a fitness band (considering the erratic step counts)PS: If this review did help, please like it. 🙏","Reviewed in India on 7 May 2021","Shame on OnePlus",2,"","44","Smart Band"

"R1Y8PWRUN6OPF1","Mohan Raj S","I have been looking for a band/smart watch that can let me set world time on watch face, and this is the first one that satisfied my requirement. Most smart watches have poor battery life even though it let me to have world time watch faces so not a workable solution. This is a very basic feature but yet none of the designers considered. Thanks to Oneplus for giving this watch face.I don't really had lot of expectations on the activity tracker. consistent step counter and reasonable batter life is all I wanted. Detail review of each feature belowBuild quality - Looks very good and I feel it looks better than Mi band 5. Strap is comfortable too.Display and touch screen - Good Amoled display with good touch sensitivity. No problem whatsoever.Step counter -  It is quite consistent but not sure if it is accurate. I felt it missed a few steps but in general I had similar counts for a 30 mins walk every day.Battery - I started with 73%. on fourth day I have 18% now. As per this estimate it will last for 6/7 days. It is bit a disappointment because the company claims 14 days battery. I use only 40% brightness and 20% between 7PM to 6AM. Only a few notifications a day. 5 seconds of display timeout. heart rate and SPO are all switched.Charging -  This is a poor design. Need to take out the capsule from the band to charge it.Activity tracker - Never used itWatch faces -  There are very less watch faces. None of them shows bluetooth status or battery status. watch faces that shows tracker data like step counter are very few. Needs lots of improvement in this regard. However, it gives me world clock watch face which is much needed for me so I am very happy with it. I wish it let me have a few more city time zones as well though. This is however can be fulfilled indirectly by having more watch faces with different time zones. It is easy to change watch face by swiping right (but only 5 watch faces can be stored in the band)Sleep tracking - It is erratic at times and not very consistent. Even when I slept well, it says I was awake at time. This may need software update to improveHeart rate, SPO - I used it only once and no clue about the accuracy. I find these features are not really workable as it is going to drain the battery and defeat the purpose of 24/7 tracking. It is good to use it on need basis thoughOther - Camera remote shutter, alaram, goal reached alert, alert to move around are very good","Reviewed in India on 17 January 2021","At last band with world time watch face",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eIYVAAJ4L.jpg","20","Smart Band"

The SPO2 monitor and heart rate monitor are spot on, cross checked with apple watch and Dr Trust SPO2 monitor. Notifications are instant and touch feedback as well the amoled screen quality is amazing.The step tracking is off by a big margin which was unexpected. Compared to apple watch, the steps were less by a margin of 10%.(4500 steps in band against 5000+ steps on apple watch). Oneplus should work ASAP to improve the same via an update. Another minor thing is that the band though looks premium and is comfortable to wear on a regular basis, but wearing the band at night to track sleep was slightly uncomfortable. This can be subjective though based on wrist size/orientation of watch while sleeping.Overall,Pros:1. Looks premium2. Accurate SPO2 measurement3. Accurate heart rate measurement4.

"R1U6V60CNFBHWV","Janardan Misra","This review is based upon my experience of using OnePlus band for the last 3 months. The best feature of the band is sleep time SPO2 measurements, which though might not be as accurate as medical grade oximeters, however, give reasonably good indication of problem if there is any. For example, this could be of immense use for those who snore or are in old age.  Next best thing is its recommendations for improving sleep quality and problems in sleep and their potential effects in our health - I found them scientifically well founded as well as informative as compared to other band like Honor Band 5.Now coming to negative side of it. In my experience its battery discharges quite fast if you use SPO2 monitoring feature. Another problem is that currently its watch faces are quite limited and may not interest all. Lastly, screen is practically invisible during sunlight so if you want to use it to check time during day time (which I guess is quite natural), it is going to be tough to figure out.","Reviewed in India on 18 January 2021","Key differentiating feature - tracking SPO2 during sleep!",4,"","6","Smart Band"

So if you own mi device go for mi band if you own OnePlus device go with OnePlus band.Overall am impressed with what this offers. It's fast and build quality seems perfectly fine for the asking price. You won't go wrong with this purchase.PS: don't expect smartwatch features on this band!","Reviewed in India on 16 January 2021","If own OnePlus device go for it",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A16XfkAQ46L.jpg

The silicon sleeve breaks. Gotta order strap now..Review after 1 wk usageTo start with, I'm okay with this being first smart band. step tracking, camera control and phone finder, sedentary alert, etc. the basic features i expected out of smart band is all there.Pros I see- auto tracks steps- spo2 and heart rate seem pretty ok. (didnt have an actual medical device to compare though)- fits in smooth, adjustable strap- waterproof and dust doesnt settle much, cleaning is fairly easy- phone alerts available if needed.- first charge lasted me a week with heart rate and spo2 checked occasionally.- app is fine. shows u history of activity etc- camera and fone finder works nice (bluetooth pairing should be kept always on)Cons- sleep tracking is worst. as u will find in reviews everywhere. hoping to see OTA updated resolve it soon.- price could have been a little lesser considering only SPO2 is the difference between this and mi5 band- if u keep vibration mode on and switch on phone notifications , charge would run out in no time.- device needs to be popped out for charging. could have been avoided. especially if we lose charging cable or if the device fitting doesnt stand after a while...","Reviewed in India on 1 February 2021","didnt disappoint for being first Smart Band",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713naDtheaL.jpg",1,"Smart Band"

"R36RWBRKR1P6E1","Vinod S","While the product looks good I was not able to complete the set up as it could not pair with my 5 year old Samsung J2 Pro. The OnePlus Health app got installed but when it came to the Bluetooth pairing stage the problem occurred. The phone did recognise the device and provided a numeral code which had to be entered into the device. The app said ""Pairing failed"" and mentioned ""if you are requested to enter a pairing code on your device, your phone cannot be paired with your device"". The specs of the watch says that the Supported Systems are Android 6.0 and above & Bluetooth 4.2 and above, both of which the Samsung J2 Pro has and yet proved incompatible. This may not happen with other brands or Samsung models but nevertheless it would help to be cautious and reconsider buying this smart watch if you have a mobile which is 5 years or older. I chose not to return the watch considering the fair price of Rs. 1500 and also since I am considering upgrading my phone.Edit (20.01.22): I installed the OnePlus Health app on a 4 year old Moto G5 and the Bluetooth pairing was successful. The Moto G generated a pairing code and this code appeared on the watch too. After that, the set up went smoothly and the watch functioned normally.While it is natural to expect the best out of the battery, it does depend on the user's appetite for all the functions the watch caters to. If limited to just the time function, I observed the battery charge percentage dropped by 5% in a 24 hour period. I disabled Bluetooth on the phone too. Heart rate and SPO2 readings can be taken whenever needed. Pairing the watch with the app via Bluetooth only during periods of activity would also help conserving battery drain. This watch is definitely not meant for fitness freaks and they would be better off investing in brands like Titan or Samsung or Apple. With a price tag of Rs. 1500, the OnePlus has its limitations and a prospective Buyer needs to factor this.","Reviewed in India on 18 January 2022","Device did not pair with a 5 year old Samsung phone.",4,"",0,"Smart Band"

Yet, i had read many review's in amazon as well as outside and it was mostly positive. This was for my father and he absolutely loved it. i got some bands before but he was not able to read from screen in sunlight due to his eyesight and for some bands we dont have brightness adjustment. One plus also offers that and he is able to see screen and he loves this product. one thing to mention here is battery, it could be improved a little bit since he has to charge it every three days once.","Reviewed in India on 15 September 2021","Good One",4,"",0,"Smart Band"

Other than walking step and Oxygen level check, no other functions work properly. Even it is not able to measure the steps we climbed. It can't automatically detect for any sports or gym experience I am doing, but even if start it manually than also it actually don't detect what i am doing, if I seat ideal than also it keep counting.

"R1OIDZD85Q3N2Y","Shashank Kamble","Intial review based on a day's use:Got the band delivered on 15th Jan 2021. Delivery was smooth and on time. No damage. 5 stars there.Packaging:Box is typical OnePlus combination of white+red color. Nothing to write home about. It doesn't give you any premium feel. But okay for this price range.Band:Band comes only with black strap by default. One can order different color straps (blue and grey) from OnePlus store for now. The black looks classy though :)First thing first, detach the  tracker screen and plug it to charging dock. Attaching and detaching tracker from strap is very easy. Though plugging it on charging dock took a while to get that ""click"" sound. Charging wire is very small. It's better to connect it to a laptop than a power adapter.Intial battery level was 66% and it charged up to 100 quickly.On the bottom of tracker are dedicated sensors for heart rate and SpO2 monitoring.Watch face:Lot of faces to select from: digital, analog, photos.Some are good. Others are meh!Lift up your hand to turn on the screen and view time. Take your hand down and screen turn off immediately. Serves the purpose!Screen:Amoled screen is good. Visibility is good even under direct sunlight. Touch operation is smooth. If you're first time user of a band, you will feel no lag. Don't compare it with your OnePlus touch though ;)Features:Lot of things here:TimeStep trackerHeart rate monitorSpO2Workout trackerSleep monitorPhone notificationsPhone cameraPhone musicFind PhoneAlarmTimer and stopwatchWeatherAll features are good. You can control which app notifications you want to receive on the band. And lot of other settings and preferences can be done through the health app.Heart rate monitor wasn't accurate much. I compared it with an oximeter. While SpO2 readings were close on oximeter and band, the heart rate on the band was way off. It did catch up with the oximeter reading but it takes time. Don't know if that's a bug or maybe I need to adjust where to wear the band.All in all a good experience so far. Makes life easy as you don't have to pick up phone to read whatsapp messages. I feel this band justifies the price it is being sold at","Reviewed in India on 16 January 2021","I'm loving it.",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/910Y1uVT1ML.jpg

Its pure waste of money and you are just sending YOUR data to let them IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCT.Reason1)You can not stop heart sensor. Even if you turn it off from the app still it takes your reading ON REGULAR INTERVAL EVEN IN NIGHT which leads to its already pathetic battery backup to go into mariana trench. Yeah, its deep.Why does it do it? Obviously, to collect data.2)Limited and completely useless faces, in many faces its not easy to distinguish between 11:51 ad 11:31 i.e. 5 and 3. For me, its like my office bus will leave me at office or at home.3)Battery back sucks and they know it. So, very cleverly, they decided to not show you when you charged it last time.4) Touch dont have any lock, it will keep measuring from heart rate to blood SpO2 level  ON ITS OWN as soon as water droplets touches its screen in shower.6)If you disconnect it for some reason, reconnecting a pain in the ass.7) NEED INTERNET CONNECTION TO EVEN OPEN ""HEALTH APP""8) Dont have ""find my band"" feature in app. You9) The only reason I bought it because Honor band was not availabe at tgat time, and I despirately needed a band because broke my last mi band strap.

"RD7HUJ8HQH96U","Akeel Taj","I received the band on 14th Jan and am writing this on 19th Jan.Have been wearing this continuously, other than the charging time.° Look and Feel: -The band looks elegant and premium. The actual device is black and the strap is dual tone(black and grey). Screen and body blend very well and the 2.5D glass makes it look even better. The strap is very comfortable and sometimes I forget I'm even wearing something on my wrist.I rate the look and feel 10 on 10 (looks are subjective so it won't be the same for others)°  Health tracking metrics :-SpO2 : very accurate but you do need to restrict rapid movements to get the results. Has a feature to monitor SpO2 during sleep with 2 modes i.e. continuous and at intervals.Heart rate: Very accurate. Has option to monitor heart rate throughout the day; 3 modes i.e. every 6 minutes, every 2 minutes, every, every second.Step counter: slightly less accurate. I walked 100 steps, it counted about 115.Sleep tracking: inaccurate. Shows a lot of 'awake time' intervals. Sleep detection really needs an improvement.Workout modes: There are 13 sports modes. I can't comment on it because I don't workout/play sports.I'd rate 'Health tracking metrics' 8.5 out of 10° Convenience and smart features:-The band offers the standard features like notifications from phone, alarms, timer, music control, stopwatch, camera control, find phone ringer, weather synced from phone. Call notifications come with option to reject and silence the call. There's a downside in the 'call silence' feature. The call notification on the band is silenced but the phone keeps ringing. Call rejection works fine.We have an option to select which apps we want to get notifications from. Music control is sophisticated. Has options to pause/play, skip to next/previous track and volume control as well in addition to displaying the song information on the band.I'd rate 'Convenience and smart features' 9.5 out of 10° Display and User Interface:Easy to use. Nothing complex. I prefer the minimalistic design of UI and it looks preety good on the AMOLED screen. The screen feels really good to look at. The UI has the scope to be snappier given OnePlus makes the snappiest variant of Android and expertise in optimization.I'd rate band UI and display 9 out of 10° Battery backup and charging:I haven't tested it under different scenarios. I have heart rate monitor working every 2 minutes, call, WhatsApp and SMS notifications enabled, SpO2 monitor at intervals during sleep tracking, brightness at 60%. I felt the battery backup to be less. It is too early to mention numbers yet but the odd thing I noticed with the battery charging and discharging is, it takes very less time to go upto 97% and then it takes ages for 98-100% and once disconnected from the charger, it comes down to 70s in the first night. Maybe something is wrong with my device here. I may update the battery statistics after a few weeks below. Charging the band requires the device to be popped out of the strap and put into the charging base which is a cumbersome process. It would've been much better to just throw it on a magnetic base as is. Also the device has to be clicked into place in the base which may wear out and loosen with time.I'd rate battery 'backup and charging' 5 out of 10↓↓↓Update on 24th of January↓↓↓The last full charge was on the evening of 20th Jan and on 24th afternoon it was at 15% with the above mentioned usage scenario.Plugged into the charger today at 15% went to 60% in 17 minutes, 82% in 70 minutes and the last bit from took the longest 25 minutes from 97 to a 100%. A total charging time of 100 minutes to go from 15 to 100%° Water resistance and durability:I have the band on my wrist at literally all times, other than the charging time of course, which includes and is not limited to using the bathroom, doing the dishes and even taking a shower. OnePlus says it should be fine upto 5 ATM of pressure and I don't see a reason to doubt that. It even has a swimming mode. About durability, the display side seems to be vulnerable to scratches, scuffs and grazing or hitting against walls. That's something in concerned about.It's rate durability and water resistance 9 out of 10° Connection stability with phone:This is where this band really shines. At least with my OnePlus 7T, it does. Not even once have I missed a notification sync from my phone to the band. It gives me notifications when the phone is upstairs (1st floor) and I'm in the ground floor.I'd rate the connection stability of this band 10 on 10° OnePlus Health app:This is an aspect where OnePlus could've really shined given there software reputation but unfortunately it's one of the worst sides of it yet. The app has things like some fixed watch faces, options to synchronize things like alarms , notifications and settings to the band. It does record all the fitness metrics but it's not refined to give you a detailed view of everything. You can't zoom in to the graphs, hourly data is available only for the same day and is not stored in a historical and detailed form. Just a bar graph showing the maximum and minimum for the previous days. Synchronization with Google Fit is a must and it lacks that. There could've been a lot of customisation options for health data, health monitoring and even the smart/convenience features, battery history and I would've loved some extra features which would work with OnePlus devices. In simple words, OnePlus must rebuild the app from scratch rather than just rebranding the Oppo Health app.Verdict:In my opinion, a OnePlus fanboy doesn't have to really give it much thought before buying and I'm happy with my purchase. Sure there are some shortcomings but it is still standing shoulder to shoulder against the competition. There's nothing really lacking here, especially considering that the price is at par with the competition too. For someone who's looking for an accurate sleep tracker or looking for great battery backup, it's not recommended.","Reviewed in India on 19 January 2021","Great display, average battery backup, accurate SpO2, HR and step counter, inaccurate sleep tracking",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91OHnx-0yeL.jpg
